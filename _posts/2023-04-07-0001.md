"Change breaks the brittle." - Jan Houtema
-------------------------------

Whether it’s the latest AI model, your boss leaving, or a new team member, change is inevitable. It’s how we adapt to it that defines our success.

But change is a two-sided coin:

On one side, we are the change: We step into new roles, bring fresh perspectives, and become the ripple that impacts others.
On the other side, we are the changed: Our boss leaves, altering team dynamics and challenging our comfort zones.

In both scenarios, empathy and communication are key. Let’s not leave people impacted by change in the dark; over-communicate with them. When we are the change, remember that our presence impacts people, especially if we’re inheriting direct reports. When we are the changed, take a deep breath. It’s going to be okay; we are valuable, and everything always works out — our lives are proof.

We are adaptable. We’ve handled change before, and we’ll do it again.
